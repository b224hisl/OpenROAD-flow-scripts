# OpenROAD Flow + FlowTune Optimization

We integrate [FLOWTUNE] (https://github.com/Yu-Utah/FlowTune) into the OpenROAD Flow Script (ORFS), with a primary focus on utilization during the ABC stage to achieve enhanced AIG reduction during synthesis. We conducted integration and validation on a small design prior to technology mapping, successfully completing the main process. 

FlowTune is a light-weight reinforcement learning solution to synthesis. This work proposes a high-performance, domain-specific multi-stage multi-armed bandit framework for Boolean logic optimization called FlowTune. The framework takes advantage of domain-specific knowledge of DAG-aware synthesis algorithms to optimize standard-cell technology mapping and end-to-end PnR assessment using various backend tools. FlowTune outperforms prior works in terms of optimization efficiency and runtime, and it is the first framework that shows end-to-end synthesis experiments in terms of post-PnR performance indicators. The domain-specific MAB algorithm can be applied to a variety of DAG-based logic synthesis, with FlowTune being used for both AIG and MIG improvements.

OpenROAD Flow is a full RTL-to-GDS flow built entirely on open-source tools.
The project aims for automated, no-human-in-the-loop digital circuit design
with 24-hour turnaround time.

## Usage method
When FLOW_TUNE is set to 1 in the flow/Makefile, a script can be invoked to perform FlowTune's optimization task. Additionally, there are several related parameters
```
FLOW_TUNE_repeat: Number of appearances of each synthesis command
FLOW_TUNE_target: Targeted metric (default = 0, i.e., AIG Minization targeting number of AIG nodes)
                : t=0 AIG Minization - Minimizing AIG nodes                       :  ftune -d i10.aig -r 4 -t 0 -p 1 -i 10 -s 5 -L [other options]
                : t=1 AIG Minization - minimizing AIG levels                      :  ftune -d i10.aig -r 4 -t 1 -p 1 -i 10 -s 5 -L [other options]
                : t=2 Technology mapping (w Gate Sizing + STA) Min STA-Delay      :  ftune -d i10.aig -r 4 -t 2 -p 1 -i 10 -s 5 -L your.lib(Liberty) [other options]
                : t=3 Technology mapping (w Gate Sizing + STA) Min Area           :  ftune -d i10.aig -r 4 -t 3 -p 1 -i 10 -s 5 -L your.lib(Liberty) [other options]
                : t=4 FPGA Mapping - Miniziming Number of 6-input LUTs            :  ftune -d i10.aig -r 4 -t 4 -p 1 -i 10 -s 5 [other options]
                : t=5 FPGA Mapping - Miniziming Levels of 6-input LUT network     :  ftune -d i10.aig -r 4 -t 5 -p 1 -i 10 -s 5 [other options]
                : t=6 SAT (CNF) Minization - Miniziming Number of Clauses         :  ftune -d cnf.aig -r 4 -t 6 -p 1 -i 10 -s 5 [other options]
                : t=7 SAT (CNF) Minization - Miniziming Number of literals        :  ftune -d cnf.aig -r 4 -t 7 -p 1 -i 10 -s 5 [other options]

FLOW_TUNE_iteration: Number of MAB iterations
FLOW_TUNE_sample: Number of MAB sampling for each iteration per Arm
FLOW_TUNE_stage
```

## limitationss
FlowTune is a parameter tuning framework that supports various optimization modes for Boolean logic optimization. Currently, the framework supports AIG optimization which we have add this tool into the ORFS, but it also offers FPGA optimization and technology mapping after synthesis. However, during the technology mapping phase, we encountered missing files in the imported ASAP7 library, as demonstrated in the code.
```
abc 01> read /workspace/0penROAD-flow-scripts/flow/results/asap7/gcd/base/output.blif
Line 10: Cannot find the model for subcircuit XOR2x2 ASAP7 75t R.Reading network from file has failed.
```

In addition, for complex designs that generate cells that cannot be recognized by Yosys, the framework may have difficulty during technology mapping before synthesis. 

FlowTune offers several different modes of operation, including:

- AIG Minimization Mode: Minimizing the number of AIG nodes or levels.
- Technology Mapping Mode: Mapping Boolean logic onto a target technology library using logic synthesisï¼Œ optimization, and mapping techniques.
- FPGA Mapping Mode: Mapping Boolean logic onto FPGA resources to achieve minimum area or delay.
- SAT Minimization Mode: Minimizing the number of clauses or literals in the Boolean formula.

Moving forward, we plan to add support for all modes of operation in OpenROAD. we will collaborate with FlowTune and OpenROAD to incorporate more excellent features into ORFS and improve its compatibility and support for different modes.
